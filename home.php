	<h2>A Quick Summary of AST101 Midterm 2013</h2>
	<h3>Focusing on the areas that need correction first.</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
		Which of the following is FALSE?
			<ul>
				<li>Our solar system contains many planets</li>
				<li>Our galaxy contains many solar systems</li>
				<li>Our universe contains many galaxies</li>
				<li>Our galaxy contains many stars</li>
				<li>Our solar system contains many stars</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answer: (e) is FALSE. There is only one star in our solar system--the sun!</p>
		</li>

			Imagine you are an alien living on a planet 50 light from Earth. You use a very, very powerful telescope to look at Earth. If you look at Earth today, you would see Earth the way it did, does, or will look in the year:
			<ul>
				<li>1913</li>
				<li>1963</li>
				<li>1988</li>
				<li>2013</li>
				<li>2063</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answer: (b). (Today) - (the time it takes for the light to travel from Earth to the alien planet) = 2013 - 50 = 1963.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Neptune is cold (about -200 C). To the naked eye, Neptune is blue in colour. Which of the
			following could correspond to the spectrum of light EMITTED by Neptune?
			<p><img src="images/ast101 midterm 2013 q3.jpg" width="522" height="308" alt="*Missing photo. Description: Various graphs on the light spectrum."></p>
			<p>Answer: (a). [This answer may require elaboration.] Notice that all of the waves, save wave A, reach a somewhat high intensity.</p>
			<p><a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/138-Why-is-Neptune-blue-">Furthermore,</a> Neptune's atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium and methane. The methane in Neptune's upper atmosphere absorbs the red light from the sun but reflects the blue light from the Sun back into space. This is why Neptune appears blue.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Which of the following best describes the motion of planets in the solar system?
			<ul>
				<li>All planets orbit in the same direction; some rotate in different directions. </li>
				<li>All planets orbit and rotate in the same direction.</li>
				<li>Planets orbit in different directions, but they all rotate in the same direction</li>
				<li>Planets orbit and rotate in all different directions.</li>
				<li>There is no general pattern to the motions of planets in our solar system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answer: (a). All planets ORBIT in the SAME direction; some ROTATE in DIFFERENT directions.</p>
			<p>Recall that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus">Venus</a> rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days, and that <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5847495/how-uranus-got-knocked-on-its-side">Uranus's</a> spin axis lies 98 degrees off of its orbital plane with the Sun (sideways).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			A star is moving away from an observer on Earth. What can the observer say about the
			wavelengths of the spectral lines of hydrogen that they will detect in the spectrum of the star,
			compared to those they would detect from a sample of hydrogen at rest in a laboratory on Earth?
			<ul>
				<li>The spectral lines of atoms are like chemical fingerprints and thus they will remain at the same wavelength.</li>
				<li>The spacings between the spectral lines will be different and the lines will be at smaller wavelengths.</li>
				<li>The spacings between the spectral lines will be different and the lines will be shifted towards the red.</li>
				<li> The spacings between the spectral lines will remain the same but they will appear at larger wavelengths. </li>
				<li> The spectral lines would change from absorption to emission lines.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answer: (d).</p>
			<p>*Need to look into this section.</p>
			<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line">spectral line</a> is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum, resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range, compared with the nearby frequencies.</p>
